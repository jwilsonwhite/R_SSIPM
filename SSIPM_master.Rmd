# SSIPM Code for Nickols et al. SONGS artificial reefs project
# Author: Will White
# Based on code in White et al. 2016 Ecol Appl and subsequent modifications

# Base code will just estimate F and R for a single site...extensions/modifications as needed

```{r}
# load necessary libraries (including eventually the SSIPM library)

```

```{r}
# Read in data
# This will work best if the data are arranged as abundance in each length bin on the rows, with a column for each annual observation. Missing years should be a column of NAs

```


```{r}
# Define the species to be examined and generate a list of fixed demographic parameters and IPM attributes/metadata
Sp <- 'PCLA'
gridsize = 150
MCMClen = 100 # how long are MCMC chains
MCMCchains = 3 # how many chains

# we may be missing a few necessary parameters in create.params()...add in as needed
fix.param <- create.params(Sp = Sp, gridsize = gridsize,MCMClen = MCMClen,MCMCchains = MCMCchains) # fix.param will be handy to pass around arguments to other functions
```

```{r}
# Set the priors for the parameters to be estimated...this list will need to be adjusted depending on the exact nature of the fitting we are doing
# for both recruitment & fishing is best done as lognormal.
# To be added - let the process error term follow an inverse gamma form instead
Prior$R.mean <- log(10) # recruitment
Prior$R.sd <- 1
Prior$F.mean <- log(0.1) # fishing
Prior$F.sd <- 0.05
Prior$error.mean = 0.1 # process error sd
Prior$error.sd = 0.1

Prior$Names <- c('r0','r1','r2','r3','F','error') # for now assume one burn-in recruitment rate, three years of observations, and one harvest rate, and one process error term

Prior$Means <- c(rep(Prior$R.mean,4),Prior$F.mean,Prior$error.mean)
Prior$SDs <- c(rep(Prior$R.sd,4),Prior$F.sd,Prior$error.sd)
Prior$Type <- rep('lognormal',6)
```

```{r}
# Setup things for fitting via MCMC
Fit <- fit.SSIPM.MCMC(fix.param,Data,Prior,savename)

# save the results...
```

```{r}
#post-processing the chains (work in progress)
Post.fit <- postproc.MCMC(Fit,fix.param) # combine chains & do diagnostic checks

```

```{r}
# Examine the prior
histogram(Post.fit$F)

```

```{r}
#Posterior predictive checks (still in progress)
```
