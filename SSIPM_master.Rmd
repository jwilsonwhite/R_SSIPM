# SSIPM Code for Nickols et al. SONGS artificial reefs project
# Author: Will White
# Based on code in White et al. 2016 Ecol Appl and subsequent modifications

# Base code will just estimate F and R for a single site...extensions/modifications as needed

```{r}
# load necessary libraries (including eventually the SSIPM library)
library(tidyverse)
library(here)

# Read in data
# This will work best if the data are arranged as abundance in each length bin on the rows, with a column for each annual observation. Missing years should be a column of NAs
